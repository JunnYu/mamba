## About

Mamba is a new state space model architecture showing promising performance on information-dense data such as language modeling, where previous subquadratic models fall short of Transformers.
It is based on the line of progress on [structured state space models](https://github.com/state-spaces/s4),
with an efficient hardware-aware design and implementation in the spirit of [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).

## Installation

```bash
pip install einops
python setup_causal_conv1d.py install
python setup_selective_scan.py install
```

Other requirements:
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- Paddle 2.6.0+
- CUDA 11.7+

## Usage

We expose several levels of interface with the Mamba model.

### Selective SSM

Mamba is based on a selective SSM layer, which is the focus of the paper (Section 3; Algorithm 2).

## Troubleshooting

### Precision
Our models were trained using PyTorch [AMP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html) for mixed precision. AMP keeps model parameters in float32 and casts to half precision when necessary.
On the other hand, other frameworks like DeepSpeed store parameters in float16 and upcasts when necessary (e.g. for optimizer accumulation).

We've observed that higher precision for the main model parameters may be necessary, because SSMs are sensitive to their recurrent dynamics. If you are experiencing instabilities,
as a first step please try a framework storing parameters in fp32 (such as AMP).

### Initialization
Some parts of the model have initializations inherited from prior work on S4 models.
For [example](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L102), the $\Delta$ parameter has a targeted range by initializing the bias of its linear projection.
However, some frameworks may have post-initialization hooks (e.g. setting all bias terms in `nn.Linear` modules to zero).
If this is the case, you may have to add custom logic (e.g. this [line](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L104) turns off re-initializing in our trainer, but would be a no-op in any other framework)
that is specific to the training framework.
